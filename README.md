## ðŸ¤” Problem

We spend a lot of their time on screens and it's quite easy to lose track of the time we spend digitally. There are existing solutions to track their life but most of them are either paid, steal personal data or aren't visually appealing. That's why we decided to build this project. It will collect data on Mobile as well as Desktop devices and show them in a Progressive Web App(PWA).

## âœ¨ Features

- Dashboard to display all the collected data from different devices.
- Background application for data collection from Desktop using NodeJS and from Mobiles using Flutter.
- NodeJS in the backend with MongoDB as the database
- Once a simple product is ready, we'll work on features to summarize our weeks and discover patterns in our behaviour.
- Tech Stack : React, NodeJS, Flutter
